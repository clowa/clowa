### Hi there 👋

I'm Cedric from Germany 🏫

As a teenager I always wanted to code and make computers do things 👨🏼‍💻 - on this way I discovered terraform and yeah, now I didn't program computers but I _code_ cloud infrastructure. ☁︎

Started with AWS and Kubernetes I'm now working with Azure and mid sized companies to adopt the cloud and build a solid and scalable foundation to run current and future workload in the cloud. ⚙
