### Hi there 👋

I'm Cedric, based in Germany 🏫

As a teenager, I harbored a passion for programming and working with modern technology. During my apprenticeship I transitioned into cloud computing and along this journey, I discovered Terraform — a pivotal moment that redirected my professional focus from traditional application development toward infrastructure engineering. Today, I specialize in designing and implementing cloud infrastructure solutions rather than writing conventional software, but I'm still always up to write code. 👨🏼‍💻

I've had the privilege of working with early AWS and Kubernetes, and I now dedicate my expertise to helping mid-sized organizations adopt Azure cloud services. My goal is to help businesses to establish robust, scalable, and sustainable foundations for their current and future cloud workloads. ⚙️
